description: Published in 1892, the author's experiences in Samoa inspired this history
  of their Civil War, which began in 1889. Stevenson's natural affinity for the underdog
  put him squarely in the camp of the indigenous inhabitants who were fighting against
  the colonial powers of England, Germany, and America.
